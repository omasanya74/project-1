                        In the early 17th century, the English physician William Harvey, who studied at Padua with one of Vesalius’s students, became the first to describe the full circulation of the blood through the human body. Prior to Harvey, blood was supposed to be consumed by the body and produced anew rather than continually circulated. It had also been suggested that the blood flowed through pores between the two halves of the heart and that the heart produced a vital heat, which was tempered by the air from the lungs. In his own work, however, Harvey demonstrated that the heart expands passively and contracts actively. By measuring the amount of blood flowing from the heart, he concluded that the body could not continuously produce that amount. He also was able to show that blood is returned to the heart through the veins, postulating a connection (the capillaries) between the arteries and veins that was not to be discovered until later in the 17th century. Harvey was also interested in embryology, to which he made a significant contribution by suggesting that there is a stage (the egg) in the development of all animals during which they are undifferentiated living masses. A biological dictum, ex ovo omnia (“everything comes from the egg”), is a summation of that concept.

                        Nehemiah Grew was educated at Cambridge and is regarded by some as one of the founders of plant anatomy. In 1672 he published the first of his great works, The Anatomy of Vegetables Begun, followed in 1682 by The Anatomy of Plants. Although Grew clearly recognized cells in plants, referring to them as vesicles, or bladders, their biological significance evaded him. He is best known for his recognition of flowers as the sexual organs of plants and for his description of their parts. He also described the individual pollen grains and observed that they are transported by bees, but he did not realize the significance of that observation. Twelve years after the publication of The Anatomy of Plants, a German physician utilized Grew’s anatomical studies in experiments to verify sexual reproduction in plants.

                        Of the five microscopists, Robert Hooke was perhaps the most intellectually preeminent. As curator of instruments at the Royal Society of London, he was in touch with all new scientific developments and exhibited interest in such disparate subjects as flying and the construction of clocks. In 1665 Hooke published his Micrographia, which was primarily a review of a series of observations that he had made while following the development and improvement of the microscope. Hooke described in detail the structure of feathers, the stinger of a bee, the radula, or “tongue,” of mollusks, and the foot of the fly. It is Hooke who coined the word cell; in a drawing of the microscopic structure of cork, he showed walls surrounding empty spaces and referred to the structures as cells. He described similar structures in the tissue of other trees and plants and discerned that in some tissues the cells were filled with a liquid while in others they were empty. He therefore supposed that the function of the cells was to transport substances through the plant.
