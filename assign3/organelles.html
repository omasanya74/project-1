                  Ribosomes are made up of ribosomal proteins and ribosomal RNA (rRNA). In a eukaryotic cell, ribosomes constitute half ribosomal RNA and half ribosomal proteins.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Each ribosome is made up of two subunits i. e large subunit and small subunit with their own distinct shapes. These subunits are designated as the 40s and 60s in the animal cell.

                  Ribosomes that occur as free particles are attached to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane occurring in large numbers accounting for about a quarter of the cell organelles. A single replicated cell has about 10 million ribosomes.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The ribosomal subunits are the site for genetic coding into proteins. On the ribosomes, the mRNA helps determine the coding for Transfer RNA (tRNA) which also determines the protein amino acid sequences.

                <li>
                  Within its membranes, there are membranous spaces called the cristae spaces and the membrane folding are called cristae.

                <li>
                  The ER has more than half the membranous cell content, hence it has a large surface area where chemical reactions take place. They also contain the enzymes for almost all the cell lipid synthesis hence they are the site for lipid synthesis.

                  Their primary function is to transport, modify and pack proteins and lipids into the Golgi vesicles to deliver them to their target sites. Animal cells contain one or more Golgi bodies while plants have a few hundred.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Cis and trans Golgi network make up the outer layer of cisternae at the cis and trans face and they are responsible for sorting proteins and lipids received at the cis face and released by the trans face, by the Golgi bodies.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The cis face collects the proteins and lipids, of fused vesicles in clusters. The fused vesicles move along the microtubules through a specialized compartment known as the vesicular-tubular cluster.  This compartment is found between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Sorting of the modified proteins and lipids occurs in the trans-Golgi network and packed into the trans vesicles, which then delivers them to the lysosomes or sometimes to the cell membrane for exocytosis. Assisted by ligands bound to receptors triggering fusion and protein secretion.
