                  It is a specialized matrix that covers the surface of the plant cell. Every plant cell has a cell wall layer which is a major distinguishing factor between a plant cell and an animal cell.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The cell wall is made up of two layers, a middle lamella, and a primary cell wall and sometimes a secondary cell wall.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The middle lamella acts as the strengthening layer between the primary walls of the neighboring cells.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The primary wall is made up of cellulose underlying the cells that are dividing and maturing. The primary wall is a lot thinner and less rigid as compared to those of the cells that have reached complete maturation. The thinness allows the cell wall to expand.
                </li>

                <li>
                  It is semipermeable hence it allows in and out, the circulation of materials such as water, molecular nutrients, and minerals.

                <li>
                  It also forms provides a rigid building block to stabilize the plant to produce some of its structures, for example, the stem and leaves of the plants.
                </li>
                <li>
                  It also provided a site for storage of some elements such as the regulatory molecules that detect pathogens in the plant, hindering the development of diseased tissue.

                  Microfilaments, also known as actin filaments, are a meshwork of fibers running parallel to each other. They are made up of the thin strands of actin proteins hence the name actin filaments. They are the thinnest filaments of the cytoskeleton with a thickness of 7 nanometers.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Intermediate filaments have a diameter of about 8-12 nm; They lie between the actin filaments and the microtubules. Its function in plant cells is not clearly understood

                <li>                  
                  Microtubules are hollow tubes made up of tubulins, with a diameter of 23nm. They are the largest filament compared to the other two filaments.

                </li>
                <li>
                  They also participate in cytoplasmic streaming, a process of cytosol flow all over the cell, transporting nutrients and cell organelles.

                <li>
                  Unlike the role of the microtubule in cell division in the animal cell, the plant cell uses the microtubules to transport materials within the vell and they are also used in forming the plant cell, cell wall.
